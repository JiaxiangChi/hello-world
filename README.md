# hello-world
first try

Hello everyone!
I'm Rick Chi and I'm from China, pls feel free to call me Rick.

When it comes to my background.
I was born in China and finished my bachelor degree in a high-level University in China, I studied electric engineering. 
However, I was immersed into financial data analysis when in the second year undergraduate study, so I decided to transfer my major. Then I went to the U.K to study finance and graduated from a good school in London.

Now I am a banker striving to learn Python for the better application to my own job.
I'm really new to here and nice to meet everyone! Nice to meet the open world!
